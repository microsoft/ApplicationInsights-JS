# OpenTelemetry Web SDK - Migration Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the migration planning strategy for transitioning from existing telemetry solutions to the OpenTelemetry Web SDK. This is currently a planning document that will be expanded with detailed migration guides, tools, and examples once the OpenTelemetry Web SDK implementation is complete.

## Future Migration Support

### Planned Migration Scenarios

The OpenTelemetry Web SDK will support migration from the following telemetry solutions:

1. **Application Insights JavaScript SDK**
   - Configuration mapping utilities
   - API compatibility wrappers
   - Data format converters
   - Gradual migration tools

2. **Other OpenTelemetry Implementations**
   - Community OpenTelemetry Web SDK
   - Custom OpenTelemetry setups
   - Configuration migration tools

3. **Custom Telemetry Solutions**
   - Generic telemetry event mappers
   - Custom instrumentation converters
   - Data validation frameworks

### Migration Strategy Framework

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
- Inventory current telemetry implementation
- Map existing telemetry to OpenTelemetry concepts
- Define migration scope and timeline
- Establish rollback procedures

#### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
- Install OpenTelemetry SDK alongside existing solution
- Configure basic instrumentation
- Validate data collection and export
- Compare telemetry data between systems

#### Phase 3: Feature Migration
- Migrate core telemetry functionality
- Implement custom instrumentation
- Configure advanced features
- Validate business-critical scenarios

#### Phase 4: Cutover and Cleanup
- Gradually increase OpenTelemetry traffic
- Monitor system performance and data quality
- Remove legacy instrumentation
- Complete migration validation

## Planned Migration Tools

### Configuration Converters
- **Application Insights Config Converter**: Automated conversion of AI configuration to OpenTelemetry format
- **Generic Config Mapper**: Flexible mapping system for custom telemetry configurations
- **Validation Utilities**: Tools to verify configuration correctness and completeness

### API Compatibility Wrappers
- **Application Insights Compatibility Layer**: Drop-in replacement APIs for gradual migration
- **OpenTelemetry Community Bridge**: Compatibility with existing OpenTelemetry community implementations
- **Custom API Adapters**: Flexible adapters for proprietary telemetry APIs

### Data Validation Framework
- **Dual Tracking Validator**: Side-by-side data collection and comparison
- **Migration Test Suite**: Automated testing for migration scenarios
- **Data Consistency Checker**: Validation of data integrity during migration

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

### Data Format Differences
**Challenge**: Different attribute naming conventions and data structures between telemetry systems.

**Planned Solution**: 
- Automated attribute mapping utilities
- Configurable data transformation pipelines
- Semantic convention alignment tools

### Missing Functionality
**Challenge**: Legacy SDK features not directly available in OpenTelemetry.

**Planned Solution**:
- Feature gap analysis tools
- Custom implementation bridges
- Alternative approach documentation

### Performance Concerns
**Challenge**: Different performance characteristics during migration.

**Planned Solution**:
- Performance comparison tools
- Optimization configuration guides
- Gradual rollout strategies

## Migration Timeline Template

### Pre-Migration Phase
- Document current telemetry implementation
- Analyze migration requirements
- Plan migration strategy
- Set up testing environments

### Migration Implementation Phase
- Install OpenTelemetry Web SDK
- Configure parallel data collection
- Implement gradual migration
- Validate data consistency

### Post-Migration Phase
- Monitor system performance
- Complete legacy system removal
- Update documentation
- Conduct migration review

## Future Documentation

Once the OpenTelemetry Web SDK implementation is complete, this document will be expanded to include:

### Detailed Migration Guides
- Step-by-step migration procedures for each supported telemetry solution
- Code examples and configuration samples
- Common migration patterns and best practices

### Migration Tools and Utilities

   - Finalize SDK architecture and APIs
   - Implement core telemetry functionality
   - Establish configuration patterns

2. **Develop Migration Framework**
   - Build configuration conversion tools
   - Create API compatibility layers
   - Implement data validation utilities

3. **Create Migration Documentation**
   - Detailed migration guides for each scenario
   - Code examples and best practices
   - Performance optimization guides

4. **Test Migration Scenarios**
   - Validate migration tools with real applications
   - Performance impact assessment
   - Data consistency verification
