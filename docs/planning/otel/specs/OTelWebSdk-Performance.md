# OpenTelemetry Web SDK - Performance Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the performance strategy for the OpenTelemetry Web SDK implementation, covering performance targets, optimization techniques, monitoring strategies, and performance testing approaches.

## Performance Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Minimal Impact**: The SDK should have negligible impact on application performance
2. **Lazy Initialization**: Components should be initialized only when needed
3. **Efficient Data Structures**: Use memory-efficient data structures and algorithms
4. **Batch Processing**: Group operations to reduce overhead
5. **Tree-Shaking Friendly**: Enable aggressive dead code elimination

### Performance-First Design
- **Zero-cost abstractions** where possible
- **Avoid synchronous operations** that could block the main thread
- **Minimize memory allocations** in hot paths
- **Use object pooling** for frequently created objects
- **Implement efficient cleanup** to prevent memory leaks

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Lazy Initialization Pattern

Implement lazy initialization to defer expensive operations until they are actually needed:

- Store provider instances as local variables within the Dynamic Proto closure
- Only create providers when first accessed
- Use performance measurements to track initialization costs
- Ensure all private state remains in the constructor closure

### 2. Object Pooling for Spans

Implement object pooling to reduce memory allocations:

- Maintain a pool of reusable span objects
- Reset objects instead of creating new ones
- Set maximum pool size to prevent memory growth
- Clear data structures efficiently without recreating objects

### 3. Efficient Attribute Management

Optimize attribute storage and access:

- Use type-specific Maps for different attribute types (string, number, boolean)
- Implement lazy Map creation to save memory when attributes are empty
- Provide efficient iteration without object creation
- Minimize memory allocations during attribute operations

### 4. Batch Processing Optimization

Group operations to reduce overhead:

- Batch telemetry items before processing
- Use configurable batch sizes and timeouts
- Implement efficient flush mechanisms
- Clean up timers and resources properly

## Performance Monitoring and Metrics

### Internal Performance Tracking

Implement performance tracking capabilities:

- Track operation durations and performance metrics
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption
- Check operations against performance budgets
- Report budget violations and performance regressions

### Performance Metrics Collection

Collect comprehensive performance data:

- **SDK operation metrics**: Initialization, runtime operations, memory usage
- **Browser performance metrics**: Navigation timing, resource timing, frame rates
- **Runtime metrics**: Operation rates, batch sizes, export frequency
- **Memory metrics**: Heap usage, span memory consumption, context overhead

## Browser Performance Integration

### Performance Observer Integration

Leverage browser performance APIs:

- Use PerformanceObserver to monitor SDK operations
- Track performance entries for SDK-specific operations
- Create performance marks for key SDK operations
- Measure operation durations using browser timing APIs
- Provide fallbacks for browsers without PerformanceObserver support

### Resource Impact Monitoring

Monitor SDK impact on application resources:

- Establish baseline metrics before SDK initialization
- Track memory usage, CPU time, and network requests
- Monitor DOM node count and other resource indicators
- Calculate SDK impact relative to baseline
- Report resource consumption metrics

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Benchmark Suite

Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking:

- **Initialization benchmarks**: SDK startup, provider creation, first operation
- **Runtime benchmarks**: Span creation, attribute operations, context operations
- **Memory benchmarks**: Memory usage patterns, cleanup efficiency, leak detection
- **Export benchmarks**: Batch preparation, serialization, network operations
- **Regression detection**: Compare against historical performance data

### Performance Regression Detection

Monitor for performance degradations:

- Maintain historical performance data
- Calculate statistical baselines and thresholds
- Detect significant performance regressions
- Report regression severity and impact
- Provide actionable insights for performance issues

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Code-Level Optimizations

#### 1. Minimize Object Creation
Avoid creating objects in hot paths:
- **Problem**: Creating closures and objects repeatedly in frequently called functions
- **Solution**: Reuse functions and minimize allocations by creating shared utilities
- **Pattern**: Create helper functions once and reuse them across operations

#### 2. Use Efficient Data Structures
Choose appropriate data structures for access patterns:
- **Problem**: Using arrays for frequent lookups (O(n) complexity)
- **Solution**: Use Maps for O(1) lookups when key-based access is needed
- **Pattern**: Match data structure to usage pattern for optimal performance

#### 3. Implement Lazy Evaluation
Defer expensive computations until needed:
- **Pattern**: Cache results and only recompute when data changes
- **Implementation**: Use dirty flags to track when cached data needs refreshing
- **Benefit**: Avoid repeated expensive operations on unchanged data

### Bundle Size Optimization

#### Tree-Shaking Configuration
Ensure optimal dead code elimination:
- Export individual functions and classes rather than default exports
- Avoid side effects in module initialization
- Use proper TypeScript configuration for tree-shaking
- Structure code to enable granular imports

#### Dynamic Imports for Optional Features
Load features on demand:
- Use dynamic imports for advanced or optional functionality
- Implement feature detection and progressive enhancement
- Load plugins and extensions only when needed
- Reduce initial bundle size through code splitting

## Performance Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Use browser dev tools to identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Measure Everything**: Add performance measurements to all critical paths
3. **Optimize for Common Cases**: Focus on the 80% use case first
4. **Use Performance Budgets**: Set and enforce performance limits
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Track performance metrics in CI/CD

### Runtime Guidelines
1. **Minimize Main Thread Blocking**: Use `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical work
2. **Batch Operations**: Group similar operations together
3. **Use Passive Event Listeners**: Avoid blocking scroll and touch events
4. **Implement Progressive Loading**: Load features as needed
5. **Clean Up Resources**: Always dispose of resources properly

### Memory Management
1. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Remove event listeners and clear references
2. **Use Object Pooling**: Reuse objects in hot paths
3. **Implement Weak References**: Use WeakMap/WeakSet where appropriate
4. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Track heap size and garbage collection
5. **Set Memory Limits**: Implement bounds on data structures

## Performance Targets

**Note**: Performance targets will be validated through comprehensive benchmarking during implementation. Targets are based on web application requirements and Application Insights SDK performance analysis.
